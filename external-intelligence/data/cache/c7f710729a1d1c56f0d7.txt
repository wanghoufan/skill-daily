# Gentle AI — Branch & PR Skill

## When to Use

Load this skill whenever you need to:
- Create a branch for a new fix or feature
- Open a pull request on [Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai)
- Prepare changes for review

## Critical Rules

1. **Every PR MUST visibly link an approved base-repository issue** — `Closes/Fixes/Resolves #<N>` closes it on merge; `Refs #<N>` is non-closing. Every accepted reference MUST have `status:approved`; malformed, cross-repository, or mixed closing/non-closing references for the same issue are rejected by CI.
2. **Ordinary `type:*` categorization** — CI rejects zero or multiple type labels. Route it through the canonical issue-creation workflow contract: a current direct human instruction binds the exact target/action, target-host capability is verified, and it uses one bounded mutation and target-host readback; otherwise wait without mutation.
3. **Protected policy labels** — Adding or removing `status:approved` or `size:exception` requires verified policy authority from a target-host repository maintainer or repository-authorized approver for the exact target/action, plus authenticated actor target-host `viewerPermission` `MAINTAIN` or `ADMIN`. `size:exception` additionally requires documented over-budget rationale.
4. **400-line review budget** — keep PRs within 400 changed lines (`additions + deletions`) or document the rationale required for a `size:exception` label.
5. **Automated checks must pass** — see the Automated Checks table below.
6. **No `Co-Authored-By` trailers** — never add AI attribution to commits.
7. **No force-push to main/master** — protected branch.

## Workflow

```
1. Confirm the issue has status:approved
   gh issue view <N> --repo Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai

2. Create a branch from main using the naming convention below

3. Implement changes following specs and design

4. Run checks locally (format + unit + E2E)

5. Commit using Conventional Commits format

6. Open a PR referencing the issue
   → Declare exactly ONE type:* result in the PR body
   → Use the canonical issue-creation workflow contract before any PR-label mutation
   → Fill in the PR body using the template

7. All automated checks must pass before merge
```

## Branch Naming

Branch names **must** match this pattern:

```
^(feat|fix|chore|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|revert)\/[a-z0-9._-]+$
```

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| `feat/` | `feat/user-login` |
| `fix/` | `fix/duplicate-observation-insert` |
| `docs/` | `docs/api-reference-update` |
| `refactor/` | `refactor/extract-query-sanitizer` |
| `chore/` | `chore/bump-bubbletea-v0.26` |
| `style/` | `style/fix-linter-warnings` |
| `perf/` | `perf/optimize-catalog-loading` |
| `test/` | `test/add-pipeline-coverage` |
| `build/` | `build/update-goreleaser-config` |
| `ci/` | `ci/add-e2e-docker-job` |
| `revert/` | `revert/undo-model-picker-change` |

**Rules:**
- All lowercase
- Use hyphens, dots, or underscores as separators (no spaces, no uppercase)
- Description must be short and descriptive

---

## PR Body Format

The PR body must follow the template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. All sections are required unless marked optional.

- [ ] `type:bug` — Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] `type:feature` — New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [ ] `type:docs` — Documentation only
- [ ] `type:refactor` — Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] `type:chore` — Build, CI, or tooling changes
- [ ] `type:breaking-change` — Breaking change

## 📝 Summary

## 🧪 Test Plan

**Unit Tests**
\`\`\`bash
go test ./...

## Automated Checks

These checks run on every PR and **all must pass** before merge:

| Check | What It Verifies | How to Fix |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Check PR Cognitive Load** | PR stays within 400 changed lines (`additions + deletions`) or has `size:exception` | Split the PR, or document the `size:exception` rationale and verify policy authority before its canonical workflow action |
| **Check Issue Reference** | PR body contains a visible, well-formed base-repository `Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N` or `Refs #N` | Add one valid reference; malformed, cross-repository, and mixed closing/non-closing references for the same issue fail |
| **Check Issue Has `status:approved`** | Linked issue has the required label | Use the canonical issue-creation workflow contract only when a current direct instruction and target-host capability grant authorize the exact action; otherwise wait |
| **Check PR Has `type:*` Label** | Exactly one `type:*` label is applied to the PR | Use the canonical issue-creation workflow contract only when a current direct instruction and target-host capability authorize the exact action; otherwise wait |
| **Unit Tests** | `go test ./...` passes | Fix failing tests before pushing |
| **Go Format** | `go run ./internal/gofmtcheck` passes | Format malformed Go files before pushing |
| **E2E Tests** | `cd e2e && ./docker-test.sh` passes | Fix failing E2E scenarios before pushing |
